<h4>Welcome to coding class 101 , here you will be required to understand all the basics of coding , beginning with :Step 1: Work Out Why You Want To Learn How To Code
Now, the first thing that you need to do - before you even think about enrolling in courses or starting to watch YouTube videos about coding - is to ask yourself why you want to learn to code.

Sit down and think carefully about what you hope to get out of it, why coding is a skill that you want to learn, and how much time and money you have to commit to it.

Consider:

What sort of skills you want to end up with. Do you want to become a website developer? Or perhaps you would prefer to be able to build mobile apps or work in software engineering? You will need to think carefully about this because it will largely dictate the languages that you are going to learn.
Why do you want to learn to code? Is learning how to code simply something which interests you that you are going to be doing in your spare time? Or is programming something that you would like to pursue a career in further down the track?
How much time and money you can commit. If you are only going to have a couple of hours per week to commit to learning how to code, there probably isnâ€™t a whole lot of point enrolling in an intensive course. In the same way, if you want to join an intensive course with support, you will have to be prepared to pay for it.
Identify and write down your coding goals and store them somewhere safe. These will quickly become the basis of your journey from novice to master coder.</h4>
